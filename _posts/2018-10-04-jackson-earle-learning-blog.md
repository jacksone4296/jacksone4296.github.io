This week we have started the fundamentals of using CSS to identify structure with shapes and flags. We are using flags to identify locations where to put shapes and overlay them making a countries flag. They keep on overlaying into easier or harder shapes. I'm am starting a flag which is the flag for the country Tunisia. That includes 1 rectangle 3 circles and 1 star which all layer ontop of eachother for a more detailed structure, rather than a flag of Japan.
