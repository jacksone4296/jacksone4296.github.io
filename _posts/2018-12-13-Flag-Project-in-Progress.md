![MY FLAG](/images/tunisiaP1.png)

```
include image

size = 100

width = size * 3
height = size * 2

base = rectangle(width, height, "solid", "red")

circle-r = height / 4

half-height = height / 2
half-width = width / 2

wc1 = circle(circle-r,"solid","white")
wc1f = place-image(wc1, half-width, half-height, base)

rc = circle(circle-r * 0.75, "solid", "red")
rcf = place-image(rc, half-width, half-height, wc1f)

wc2 = circle(circle-r * 0.6, "solid", "white") 
```

These past 2 weeks we have started back up the flag project to the level of need for the AP CSP exams, I got the option of the last flag I did which was the flag of Tunisia. In this project you were supossed to make a flag that if you changed the size it changed the whole flag to make so that it fit the new size. So it you changed the size the circles would change to match it. I faced multiple complications with this task, such as finding the correct size of the circle to make it so that when you changed the size of the circle it would actually match the change of the rest of the code. Another issue was how to start, I didn't know where to start with the code until the second class of working on it, I was just messing around with my old code until I figured something I out. I had to go back to my notes multiple times to know where to start. But now once I started the whole picture has really came together so I understand whats going on pretty well.
