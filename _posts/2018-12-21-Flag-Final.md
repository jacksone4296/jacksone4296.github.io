## Flag of Tunisia by Jackson Earle

## Describe your program

-   What country did you design for? 
The countries I had the option to design were Greece and Tunisia, I chose Tunisia to be my flag because I made it earlier this year so I thought it would be rather simple.

-   What grade do you expect? 
I expect to get a professional because I made a scalable representation of the Tunisian flag before the due date.
