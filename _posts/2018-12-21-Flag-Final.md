## Flag of Tunisia by Jackson Earle

## Describe your program

-   What country did you design for? 
The countries I had the option to design were Greece and Tunisia, I chose Tunisia to be my flag because I made it earlier this year so I thought it would be rather simple.

-   What grade do you expect? 
I expect to get a professional because I made a scalable representation of the Tunisian flag before the due date.

## Current output



* * *
![MY FLAG](/images/flag-final.png)
* * *

## Describe your process.

-   What questions, strategies, help from peers or teacher, or thinking got you to this point? _then delete this instruction_

Some of the strategies I had that helped me seriously was organizing the code to be something understandable to my eyes, my partner Marlon helped me with how to layer the flag in more simple way than using underlay-xy, he showed me that place-image was much easier for placing images on top of each other, which was what I needed at the time. Then the biggest issue was to find a flag construction that I could understand enough to use. This helped me with most of my other issues such as circle radius and how to do that because I used the radius of the circle for the circles and star as well.


## Explain your code.

-   Choose a significant part of your program (15 lines max) and paste it below. Do not insert your entire program here. _then delete this instruction_
-   Explain each argument in the code section. _then delete this instruction_
-   Tell us how it functions independently and within the whole program _then delete this instruction_

* * *
size = 100
width = size * 3
height = size * 2
circle-r = height / 4


* * *

-   Explain the code you posted by telling us about each argument.
-   Then tell us how your code section fits into the whole.

This is what was the basis of my code, it made everything else I used. The size function was used in every single line of code one way or another.
