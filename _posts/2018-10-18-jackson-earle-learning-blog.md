This week our class covered the idea of stacking and placing images. On monday we returned working on our flag images. I started to try and fix it up make it look better, also rotate the star. To rotate the star you had to use a function called rotate it took in a number and a image to produce another image. I found it challenging to find a number that made the image look just. In the end my flag looks like this ---------> ![MY FLAG](tunisia.png) With this day over we went onto wedsnday where we worked in pairs to try and recreate images. We found a few issues (me and my partner) such as making a right triangle, we tried a few functions such as isosceles-triangle
