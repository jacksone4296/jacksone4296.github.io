This week we did midterms and also analyzed those questions on the exam to organize what level of a question they were, also what matery skill it was. A question on the test I think I showed understanding is on question # 24. Question 24 was one that I got correct but proved to be one of the harder questions with only 34.9% of people getting it correct. The question was:

Choose the function definiton that best matches the examples below:

check:
mystery("red") is circle(10, "solid", "red")
mystery("orange") is circle(10, "solid", "orange")
end

The answer choices were

 (a)   fun mystery(z):
 circle(z,"solid", "red")
 end
 
 (b)   fun mystery(z):
 circle(10,"solid", z)
 end
 
 (c)  fun mystery(z):
 circle(10,z, "red")
 end
 
 (d) None of the above
 
 The answer being B for the reason of what was changing between the two examples in the test-box was the colors. Letter A showed it changed the size of the circle. B actually changed the color which was shown in both. C changed the solidity of the circle. Then D was none of the above which was wrong because there was an correct answer there.
