This week in class we learned about contracts and the difference betweeen contracts and an example. This week's reflection has the general question asking what a contract is. A contract is the base of a function, it has three parts to it. The first part is the name, it is the label for a function. Then we have the domain of a contract, the domain is what the contract takes in, it's what the contract reads to know what to produce. The last part of a contract is the range, the range is what the value of the contract is, what the contract knows to produce. I think the difference between a contract and a example is like comparing a first draft of an essay to the final copy the contract is the first draft, the starting build, the base of what your doing. The final draft is more like the example because it's what you produce and you get something back, the product of the example is like the grade, you get the grade back after the final draft.
